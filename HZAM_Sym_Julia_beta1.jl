# Here is a small test addition (to see if GitHub works)
# A second small test line

# Need to make sure these packages below are added.
# to add, type "]" to get the "pkg>" prompt, then type e.g. "add Distributions";
# or do this: 
# import Pkg; 
# Pkg.add("Distributions") 
# Pkg.add("Statistics") 
# Pkg.add("JLD2")
# Pkg.add("CSV")
# Pkg.add("DataFrames")
# Pkg.add("Plots")
# Pkg.add("CategoricalArrays")
# Pkg.add("Colors")
# Pkg.add("ColorSchemes")
# Pkg.add("CategoricalArrays")

using Distributions # needed for "Poisson" function
using Statistics  # needed for "mean" function
using JLD2 # needed for saving / loading data in Julia format
using CSV # for saving in csv format
using DataFrames # for converting data to save as csv

# for plotting:
using Plots
gr()  # use GR backend for graphs
using CategoricalArrays
using Colors, ColorSchemes
import ColorSchemes.plasma
using Plots.PlotMeasures  # needed for plot margin adjustment


# to start Julia with multiple threads, type in terminal e.g.:
# julia --threads 4
# To check, type in Julia: Threads.nthreads()

# set up functions (should not define functions repeatedly in loop, as causes re-compilation, slows things)
